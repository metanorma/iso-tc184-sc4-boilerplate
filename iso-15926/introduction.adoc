== Introduction

ISO 15926 is an International Standard for the representation of process plant
lifecycle information. This representation is specified by a generic, conceptual
data model that is suitable as the basis for implementation in a shared database
or data warehouse. 

The data model is designed to be used in conjunction with reference data: standard
instances that represent data common to a substantial number of experts from the
process plant engineering supply chain.

The support for a specific life-cycle activity depends on the use of an appropriate
selection of reference data in conjunction with an appropriate data model derived
from the ISO 15926 data model ontology. 

ISO 15926 is organized as a number of parts, each published separately. This document
specifies:

* ISO 15926 -- 1: Overview and fundamental principles, published in 2004;

* ISO 15926 -- 2: Data model, published in 2003;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 3: Reference data for geometry and topology, published in 2009;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 4: Initial reference data, published in 2007;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 6: Methodology for the development and validation of reference data,
published in 2013;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 7: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems:
Template methodology, published in 2013;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 8: Implementation methods for the integration of distributed systems:
Web Ontology Language (OWL) implementation, published in 2013;

Fa√ßade implementation, not yet in ballot;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 10: Conformance testing, planned published in 2018;

* ISO/TS 15926 -- 11: Methodology for simplified industrial usage of reference data,

* ISO/TR 15926-14: ISO 15926-2 Data model adapted for OWL 2 Direct Semantics planned
published in 2019;

* ISO 15926-5 has been replaced by an annex to ISO/TC 184/SC 4: Procedure for development
and maintenance of reference data in database format.
